A hyperbola is a type of curve with properties that make it seem like the **opposite of a circle** or ellipse. If you've ever played about with circular equations in Desmos and seen the graph shapes "unfurl" into infinity as various parameters slide into the negatives, ~~you're a massive nerd and~~ you've probably seen hyperbolae before.

And yes, the plural of hyperbola is ✨*hyperbolae*✨. Feel free to grab a monocle, twirl your moustache, and drink your tea with your pinky sticking out.
