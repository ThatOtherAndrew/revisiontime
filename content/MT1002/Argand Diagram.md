An Argand diagram is a **method of visualising [[Complex Number|complex numbers]]** by plotting them on a 2D plane, similar to a Cartesian diagram. However, instead of $x$ and $y$ axes, we instead have ***real* and *imaginary* axes** respectively.

It's like if we took a number line:

And extended it into a new dimension with the [[Imaginary Number]] DLC:

Note how the axes are labelled with $\mathrm{Re}$ and $\mathrm{Im}$, to represent the real and imaginary axes respectively.

This now gives us a way to plot arbitrary complex numbers as points or vectors in 2D space!

Some example points are shown below:
