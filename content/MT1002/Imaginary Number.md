An imaginary number is the mathematician's hacky solution to calculating square roots of negative numbers.

## Imaginary unit
Silly mathematicians! They couldn't figure out a real solution to the following innocent-looking expression:

$$
\sqrt{-1}
$$

And so, they made something up:

$$
\sqrt{-1} \color{yellow} = i
$$

Where $i$ is the *imaginary unit*. It is fundamentally, axiomatically, equal to the square root of $-1$ by definition. Why? Because the mathematicians were getting desperate, that's why.

More formally, an imaginary number can be defined as taking the form of $bi$, where $b$ is a real number.

> [!question]- Why does $b$ have to be real?
> Because if $b$ was imaginary, it would have an $i$ in it. Multiplying two $i$s would cancel out the square roots and you'd just get $-1$, ya silly potato.
