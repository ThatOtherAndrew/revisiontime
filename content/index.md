Heyo, and welcome to **Revision Time**! :>

## What is this?
This website here is my humble attempt at collating **high-quality notes** and other teaching material for [St Andrews](https://st-andrews.ac.uk/) university modules, with a focus on **wiki-like organisation** of information and **explaining via intuition and exploration** where possible. I hold some very strong beliefs about learning by intuition being the best way to learn, and hope for this site to reflect that.

## Please Contribute!
I started this project off just as personal notes, but it quickly became apparent that working on this alone just simply wasn't sustainable; I spent around 4 hours writing notes per 1 hour of lectures.

As such, in true wiki-like fashion, **I'm looking for your help!**

If you've got decently high-quality notes which you're proud of, which align with the values of this site, please send them my way and I'll add it in, with credit to you (if you wish). Don't worry too much about typesetting / formatting / spelling, as I'd be more than happy to deal with all that stuff!

Contributions are welcome from **all students in all years for all modules**.

If you'd be interested, check out the [[Contribution Guide]] for more information! <3

## That's all, folks!

Best of luck with your studies! If you wish to contact me for *any reason* (don't worry about bothering me - I love hearing from people!), then you can reach me at **`as714`** (preferred) or at andrew@revisionti.me!

See ya~

â€” Andrew :>
